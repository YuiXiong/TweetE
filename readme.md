```

## Introduction
A microblogging web app without wordlimit and with an edit button that is still trying to grow its functions. Currently 1 model with CRUD functional.
## Technology
MVC structure using Mongodb Express JS Node JS

## Approach
Attempts was made to create user register and sign in first. CRUD was attempted next without authentication. Styles was added to make the MVP look decent. 
## Stretch goals
```
- Authentication - TBD
- Sign out using delete sessions - TBD
- user details ref into post model and display username on tweete post- TBD
- comment model and functions - TBD
- reply comment model and function - TBD
- Selling it for 44bil - (pun intended)
```
## Difficulties
- Lack of experience designing a schema specifically ref models.
- Difficulty understanding documentation
- selective reading habit still bugs me. However compared to project 1 there are improvements else I wouldnt have solved PATCH route issues myself in 1.5hrs. 
- Tried to challenge myself in using tailwindcss when my bootstrap knowledge is also [Half-Bucket-Water](http://halfpailwater.weebly.com/), nevertheless tailwindcss feels amazing to use compared to my experience with bootstrap.(probably alrdy found comfort in an uncomfortable zone)

## Wins
- Finding comfort in an uncomfortable zone.
- Noticeable difference with volume of code produced compared to project 1.
